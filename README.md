# 🎟️ MizuPass Backend - ETH Tokyo 2025 Hackathon

> **Privacy-First Universal Ticketing Platform**
> Compliant, privacy-preserving ticketing with seamless JETH-to-MJPY payments and universal KYC verification

## 🏆 Hackathon Tracks
- 🥷 **Cypherpunks Anonymous** (Privacy & Security) - 60%
- ✊ **Counterculture Capital** (Financial Innovation) - 40%

## 🚀 What is MizuPass?

MizuPass bridges the gap between regulatory compliance and user privacy by creating the first ticketing platform that:

✅ **Universal KYC**: Mizuhiki ID (Japanese) + ZK Passport (International)
✅ **Private Payments**: Stealth addresses + ZK payment proofs
✅ **DEX Integration**: Direct JETH payments via Uniswap v3
✅ **Full Compliance**: Japanese regulatory adherence with privacy

## 🔧 Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

### Development Mode
```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

## 🛡️ ZKPassport Verification API

### POST `/api/zkpassport/verify`

**Purpose**: Verify international users via ZK Passport without revealing personal data

**Request:**
```json
{
  "queryResult": {},
  "proofs": [],
  "domain": "mizupass.xyz"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "registered": true,
  "verified": true,
  "uniqueIdentifier": "11525524...443940"
}
```

**Integration Flow:**
1. 🔐 User submits passport → ZK proof generation
2. ✅ Backend verifies proof → returns `uniqueIdentifier`
3. 🏪 Frontend calls smart contract with identifier
4. 🎫 User can purchase tickets with full privacy

## 🌐 Health Check

### GET `/health`
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
